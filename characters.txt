Jay Gatsby (originally named James Gatz) is the titular fictional character of F. 
Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel The Great Gatsby. The character is an enigmatic nouveau
 riche millionaire who lives in a luxurious mansion on Long Island where he often
  hosts extravagant parties and who allegedly gained his fortune by illicit bootlegging
   during prohibition in the United States.[5] Fitzgerald based many details about the
    fictional character on Max Gerlach,[1] a mysterious neighbor and World War I veteran
     whom the author met in New York during the raucous Jazz Age.[1] Like Gatsby, 
     Gerlach threw lavish parties,[6] never wore the same shirt twice,[7] used the 
     phrase "old sport",[8] claimed to be educated at Oxford University,[9] and 
     fostered myths about himself, including that he was a relation of the German 
     Kaiser.[10]
